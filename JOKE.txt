A man walks into a bar and notices a jar filled with $10 bills on the counter. He asks the bartender about it.

Bartender: "That's our special challenge. If you can complete three tasks, you get all the money in the jar."

Man: "What are the tasks?"

Bartender: "First, you have to drink an entire bottle of hot sauce without making a face. Second, there's a mean Rottweiler out back with a sore tooth. 
You have to pull the tooth. And lastly, our 90-year-old grandma upstairs hasn't had a good time in years. 
You have to give her a night she'll never forget."

Man thinks for a moment and decides to give it a try. He downs the entire bottle of hot sauce without flinching. 
Tears stream down his face, but he doesn't make a face.

Man: "Now, where's that Rottweiler with the sore tooth?"

As he heads out to the backyard, the bar patrons hear growls, barks, and screams. 
The man returns, clothes torn and bleeding, and says:

Man: "Okay, now where's that grandma with the sore tooth?"
